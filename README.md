# 2.5D-Game-Engine
Basic 2.5D Game Engine. Experimental.

This is a basic pseudo-3D graphics engine written in JavaScript, inspired by javidx9's command-line FPS engine. Enable hardware acceleration in your browser for the best experience.

# Usage
- Control using arrow keys.
- Toggle stats with the 's' key.
- Toggle the 2D minimap with the spacebar.
- Increase draw distance by editing the draw distance variable inside engine.js (warning: this may interfere with the raytracer).
- Increase visual fidelity by increasing the number of columns in projector.js (warning: your PC will chug).

# Future features
- Compensation for fish-eye effect.
- Performance improvements by computing things once per frame instead of per function call.
