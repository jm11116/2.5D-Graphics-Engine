Optimization ideas:

- Calculate the rotation thing every 10ms every time a key is down using a dedicated method, saving tons of work calling engine.getRotation() a dozen times each frame. Store result as property of Engine.
- Rather than test the entire length of a ray, move on to the next ray when a wall is detected. Eliminates the need for draw distance limit and prevents need for running ray calculations beyond walls.
- Calculate stuff like $("#player").position() once per frame and reference the result from a property of Engine, rather than needlessly running the position() method dozens of times per tick.

Extreme ideas:
- Cast rays once per two columns and just work out the delta manually.
